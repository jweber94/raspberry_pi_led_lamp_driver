# Raspberry Pi GPIO LED-lamp driver
This is the code and theory behind my 3D printer lamp. The aim of this project is at the one hand to develop a cool lamp to enlight my 3D printer and on the other hand to learn about linux driver development.
The main focus of this project is to learn something. I am totally aware that there are more convenient ways to achieve the same result within a linux driver.
